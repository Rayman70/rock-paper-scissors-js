# rock-paper-scissors-js
This is my first javascript project, which involves creating a 
rock, paper, and scissors game that runs completely on the console.

Update 07/14/22: I have made it interactive, by clicking on pictures and have
added css.

Update 07/19/22: I have added a result box to make it clearer on who won, as well as make the computer's image change according to choice.
